1. The input files:
'dataset.sentences'
'dataset.labels'
'int-keywords.txt'
and the code files written in Python 2.7:
'baseline.py'
'advanced.py'
should be placed in the same folder.

2. Running 'baseline.py' in Eclipse creates 'dataset.words_between.csv'.
Running 'advanced.py' in Eclipse creates 'dataset.interaction_words.csv'.

3. Both of these files are compatible with Weka, choosing them in Applications > Explorer, then Preprocess > Open file...
